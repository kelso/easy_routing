Shortcuts of basic routes to your views and controllers.
Advantages: DRY, less code.


In admin articles controller you can insert link to edit:

  <%= link_to "Edit", edit_admin_article_path(@article) %>

  <%= link_to "Edit", edit_url(@article) %>


There are also two redirect methods to your controllers.

  <%= link_to "Show article", show_url(@article) %>
  <%= link_to "Edit article", edit_url(@article) %>
  <%= link_to "Delete article", delete_url(@article) %>
